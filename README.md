# Ethereum-Wallet-Dashboard
A descriptive web app, detailing the history of all transactions including all different kinds of ERC transactions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All available scripts run under the front end folder of this repository. You must have Node installed on your 
computer and to have access to the npm package manager which will allow you to download external libraries and
also run, build, and test your react app.

Additional documentation on the app and its functions will be provided as the project completes.

****** DISCLAIMER **************
Running this project locally will require you to also acquire separate API keys for running resource requests 
from Etherscan/Moralis/Opensea. They are hidden in this project under the .env file which was not committed to
GitHub for obvious security reasons. 

No API keys means failed requests to select API resources. More details on API documentation used, to come 
as the project nears completion. 

********************************

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
